Sabko ved ke baare mein pata hoga but let me tell you about rhythm genius guy stidied everything. Teachers ke pass bhi material khatam hogya tha physics ka isse dene ke liye kyunki ye sab kar leta tha aur isne btech level ki mechanics kar rakhi hai with all classic engineering books. So you can't talk dogshit about these people that they prepare this for 4 year degree. They are talents of this country but unfortunately jayenge to ye log usa hi yahan kyun rahenge shithole mein. Mujhe bhi allen ke teachers se hi pata laga tha he was predicted rank 1 in 2024 by allen but he got 4 that is also too good because uss din 1-10 rank kismat ki hi baat goti hai

because India mai Olympiad medals se jyada kuch nahi milta as compared to jee adv foreign universities mai uska darja hai

agar colleges Olympiad ke based selection ya merit dene lage to popularity badhegi fir media aayega +

Fake Olympiad like SOF and Silverzone ne naam kharab kar rakha hai

so real Olympiad ke baare mai awareness nahi hai jyada

Isliye media wale aur ghar wale interest nahi lete

aur bahut se reasons hai

I hope Olympiad medalists do get the respect they deserve

Bhai see olympiads are popular but only among the serious ones with real interest. It is not like JEE that you can crack with some amount of prep. Only those who are really passionate cracks so I don't think even if IITs start giving admission to OCSC camp attendes then also it become popular since it is defenitly out of thinking of an average joe.

Rather than giving direct seats to ICHO/IPHO camp attendes in top 5 IITS cse government should give direct seats to IMO/IOI camp attendes. ICHO/IPHO guys can pretty easily get under 100 or atleast 200 rank in JEE adv but IOI/IMO guy mostly had to look for other options since there is not much overlap between the syllaubus with JEE.

The CS education in our country is really pathetic and most people even in this sub also don't consider it as a real subject. For most people in our country CS is all about knowing HTML and phython. I once said in this sub that CS is mostly about algorithms and mathematics and got  d by some MFs. Some moron said me then that CS is about 6 grade mathematics🤡🤡🤡. I don't really blame then because it is the failure of our education system.

Fake is quite an exaggeration but they're private organisations although they're tough at higher levels but no way near HBCSE

competition is also not much compared to it

and the medal system is trash

like for ex if 3 students participated from your class and you came 1st from your class and other two 2nd and 3rd then also you'll be given gold medal regardless of your regional %ile or state %ile ( I have got one gold medal)

Maths questions I indeed found tough and intriguing tbh quite demotivating for me at 7th standard

and In Hbcse (real) they take you to camps and all but afaik In SOF and Silverzone there is no such thing

other reasons are also there

This Post has still 206 likes only on twitter even though it is posted by the official handle of HBCSE.
This is what happens when 99% of the schools only tell you about SOF olympiads and Silverzone Olympiads.
It is a fact that even 90% didn't even know about any of these IMO,IPho,ICho till 11th and there are lakhs of students that will pass 12th boards with flying colors and still will not know about single one of them.

Lack of Awareness is the truth. And kiddos still waiting for NTSE to happen...
